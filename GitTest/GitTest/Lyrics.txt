BRAD - V1

STEVE - Don't go around tonight,
Well, it's bound to take your life,
There's a bad moon on the rise.

LONG - I hear hurricanes a blowing. 
I know the end is coming soon. 
I fear rivers over flowing. 
I hear the voice of rage and ruin. 

JESUS - 
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the
Eye of the tiger
